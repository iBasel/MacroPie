# MacroPie

MacroPie is an iPhone app that allows you to search an online database of food, shows you a pie of macro distribution and allows you to add that food item to your journal, including adding those calories to the Health app on your iPhone.

The app uses MVVM-C, which my preferred way of architecting apps these days.
